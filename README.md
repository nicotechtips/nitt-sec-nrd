Daily updated lists of newly registered domains on the Internet; for analysis, monitoring and reporting of abuse.

## Features
- Domain names sorted alphabetically, with no duplicates from the previous day.
- Domain records are pulled from multiple sources: registrars, WHOIS APIs and web scraping.
- Includes registrations for [989 top-level domains](https://github.com/nicotechtips/nitt-sec-nrd/blob/main/TLDs.txt):
  - Some top-level domains may have a gap of up to 72 hours in their registrations.
  - Some geographic top-level domains update their records very rarely per month and may include renewals.
